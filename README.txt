PHASE 1:
        Our assembler won't accept instructions without special characters like comma,bracket,etc...

        .data and .text must be mentioned for our assembler to run.

        After compling our code first give input file .asm which contains contains assembly code and make sure that before compling there should be mcfile.mc file for writing machine code of given input file assembly code.

PHASE 2:
      expect memory allocation remaining were done.
